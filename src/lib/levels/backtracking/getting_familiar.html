<h2 id="title">Getting Familiar with Backtracking</h2>
<p>Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve problems that involve searching through all possible combinations or configurations.</p>
<p>This algorithm is mainly used as a last resort if there are no other algorithms that can solve the problem. It is a brute force algorithm that tries all possible solutions until it finds the correct one.</p>

<p>Backtracking is often used in problems involving subsets, permutations, and combinations. It is also used in constraint satisfaction problems, such as the N-Queens problem and Sudoku.</p>
<h2 id="subtitle">Combinatorics</h2>
<p>Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. Backtracking is often used in combinatorial problems to generate all possible combinations or arrangements of a set of objects.</p>
<h3>Backtracking Process</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Initialize all variables. This includes the input set, the current combination or arrangement, and any other variables needed for the algorithm.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Check if the current combination or arrangement is valid. This is done by checking if it meets the constraints of the problem.</li>
    <li>Step 3: If the current combination or arrangement is valid, add it to the result set.</li>
    <li>Step 4: If the current combination or arrangement is not valid, backtrack to the previous step and try a different combination or arrangement.</li>
    <li>Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4 until all combinations or arrangements have been generated.</li>
    <li>Step 6: Return the result set.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backtracking Boilerplate</h3>
<p>Here is a simple backtracking implementation in Python:</p>
<pre id="code">
def backtrack(current, options, result):<br>
    if (<span style="font-style: italic;">sufficient condition</span>):<br>
        result.append(current)<br>
        return<br>
    for (<span style="font-style: italic;">all available options</span>):<br>
        current.append(<span style="font-style: italic;">option</span>)<br>
        backtrack(current, <span style="font-style: italic;">less options</span>, result)<br>
        path.pop()<br>
</pre>
