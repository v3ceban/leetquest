<h2 id="title">What is Binary Search?</h2>
<p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm used for finding a target value by repeatedly cutting the search space in half. It is applicable to sorted arrays or lists, where the elements are arranged in a specific order.</p>
<h3>How Binary Search Works on a Structure:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Start with two pointers: <code id="code">left</code> and <code id="code">right</code>, representing the start and end of the search space.</li>
    <li>Calculate the middle index: <code id="code">mid = (left + right) // 2</code>.</li>
    <li>If the target value is equal to the middle element, return the index.</li>
    <li>If the target value is less than the middle element, adjust the right pointer to <code id="code">mid - 1</code>.</li>
    <li>If the target value is greater than the middle element, adjust the left pointer to <code id="code">mid + 1</code>.</li>
    <li>Moving the left and right pointers narrows down the search space by half each time.</li>
    <li>Repeat until the target value is found or the search space is empty.</li>
</ul>
