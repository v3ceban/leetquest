<h2 id="title">The Essence of Dynamic Programming</h2>
<p>Dynamic programming is a powerful technique used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller overlapping subproblems. The essence of dynamic programming lies in its ability to store the results of these subproblems, allowing for efficient computation and avoiding redundant calculations.</p>


<h2 id="subtitle">A Classic Example</h2>
<p>Consider the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. A naive recursive approach would involve recalculating the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity. By using dynamic programming, we can store the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers and retrieve them when needed, significantly improving efficiency.</p>
<p>Here is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using backtracking vs dynamic programming:</p>
<pre id="code">

def fibonacci_recursive(n):<br>
    if n &lt;= 1:<br>
        return n<br>
    return fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2)<br>
    <br>
def fibonacci(n):<br>
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)<br>
    fib[1] = 1<br>
    for i in range(2, n + 1):<br>
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]<br>
    return fib[n]<br>
</pre>

<p>The backtracking implementation may look shorter at first glance, but it is significantly less efficient than the dynamic programming approach. The recursive implementation has a time complexity of O(2<sup>n</sup>), while the dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(n).</p>
