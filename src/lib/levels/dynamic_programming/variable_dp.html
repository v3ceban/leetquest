<h2 id="title">Dynamic Programming using Variables</h2>
<p>In the previous node, we showed an example of Dynamic Programming for the Fibonacci sequence. This example is one example of Dynamic Programming with variables, where the important information is stored in variables. In this case, the variables are the previous two Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>The following couple problems will quickly test to see if you can apply the simplest form of DP to solving some problems.</p>
