<h2 id="title">What is Breadth First Search?</h2>
<p>Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level of nodes. It is often implemented using a queue data structure.</p>
<p>The level order tree traversal algorithm uses BFS to visit all the nodes in a tree or graph.</p>

<h2 id="subtitle">BFS Process</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Initialize visited set. This set will store the nodes that the algorithm has already covered.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Start at the root node. This is the first node that the algorithm will visit.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Mark the current node as visited. This ensures that the algorithm does not visit this node multiple times.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Visit all the neighbors of the current node that are NOT in the visited set. This is done by adding each neighbor to a queue.</li>
    <li>Step 5: Dequeue the next node from the queue and repeat steps 3-4 until the queue is empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>BFS Boilerplate</h3>
<p>Here is a simple BFS implementation in Python:</p>
<pre id="code">
def bfs(node):<br>
    visited = set()<br>
    queue = [node]<br>
    while queue:<br>
        current = queue.pop(0)<br>
        if current not in visited:<br>
            visited.add(current)<br>
            for neighbor in current.neighbors:<br>
                if neighbor not in visited:<br>
                    queue.append(neighbor)<br>
</pre>
