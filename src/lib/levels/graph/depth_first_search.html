<h2 id="title">What is Depth First Search?</h2>
<p>Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is often implemented using recursion or a stack data structure.</p>
<p>The basic tree traversal algorithm uses DFS to visit all the nodes in a tree or graph.</p>

<h2 id="subtitle">DFS Process</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Initialize visited set. This set will store the nodes that the algorithm has already covered.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Start at the root node. This is the first node that the algorithm will visit.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Mark the current node as visited. This ensures that the algorithm does not visit this node multiple times.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Visit all the neighbors of the current node that are NOT in the visited set. This is done by recursively calling the DFS function on each neighbor.</li>
    <li>Step 5: Repeat steps 3-4 until all nodes have been visited.</li>
</ul>
<h3>DFS Boilerplate</h3>
<p>Here is a simple DFS implementation in Python:</p>
<pre id="code">
def dfs(node, visited):<br>
    if node is None:<br>
        return<br>
    visited.add(node)<br>
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:<br>
        if neighbor not in visited:<br>
            dfs(neighbor, visited)<br>
</pre>
