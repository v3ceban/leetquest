<h2 id="title">What is a Graph?</h2>
<p>A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The value stored in the node</li>
    <li>Edges that connect to other nodes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directed Graph</h3>
<p>A directed graph is a graph where the edges have a direction. This means that the edges point from one node to another, and not vice versa.</p>
<p>For example, in the following directed graph, the edge from node A to node B indicates that there is a connection from A to B, but not from B to A:</p>

<h3>Undirected Graph</h3>
<p>An undirected graph is a graph where the edges do not have a direction. This means that the edges connect two nodes in both directions.</p>
<p>For example, in the following undirected graph, the edge between node A and node B indicates that there is a connection between A and B in both directions:</p>

<h3>Cyclic Graph</h3>
<p>A cyclic graph is a  graph that contains at least one cycle. A cycle is a path of nodes and edges that starts and ends at the same node.</p>
<p>For example, in the following cyclic graph, the path A -> B -> C -> A forms a cycle:</p>

<h3>Acyclic Graph</h3>
<p>An acyclic graph is a graph that does not contain any cycles. This means that there are no paths of nodes and edges that start and end at the same node.</p>
<p>For example, in the following acyclic graph, there are no cycles:</p>
<p>A tree is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node has at most one parent and zero or more children.</p>

<h2 id="subtitle">Graph Representations</h2>
<h3>Edge List</h3>
<p>An edge list is a representation of a graph where each edge is represented as a pair of nodes in a list. This representation is simple and easy to understand, but it can be inefficient for large graphs.</p>

<h3>Adjacency List</h3>
<p>An adjacency list is a representation of a graph where each node is represented as a list of its neighbors. This representation is more efficient than an edge list for large graphs, as it allows for faster traversal and searching.</p>

<h3>Adjacency Matrix</h3>
<p>An adjacency matrix is a representation of a graph where each node is represented as a row and column in a matrix. The value at the intersection of a row and column indicates whether there is an edge between the two nodes. This representation is less efficient than an adjacency list for large graphs, as it requires more memory and can be slower to traverse.</p>
