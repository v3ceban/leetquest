<h2 id="title">What is a Heap?</h2>
<p>A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The heap property states that for a given node, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children. This means that the smallest element is always at the root of the tree.</p>
<p>Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where the highest priority element is always at the root of the tree. Heaps can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, but they are most commonly implemented using arrays.</p>

<h3>Heapify</h3>
<p>Heapify is the process of rearranging the elements in a heap to maintain the heap property.</p>
<p>Heapify can be used on an array to transform it</p>
<ul>
    <li><code id="code">heapq.heapify(arr)</code> - Rearranges the elements in the array to maintain the heap property.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Push</h3>
<p>Pushing is the process of adding a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.</p>
<p>Push can be used on a heap to add a new element to the heap.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code id="code">heapq.heappush(arr, element)</code> - Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pop</h3>
<p>Popping is the process of removing the smallest element from the heap while maintaining the heap property.</p>
<p>Pop can be used on a heap to remove the smallest element from the heap.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code id="code">heapq.heappop(arr)</code> - Removes the smallest element from the heap while maintaining the heap property.</li>
</ul>
