<h2 id="title">What is a Linked List?</h2>
<p>A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of objects called nodes</p>
<p>Each node has the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data: The value stored in the node</li>
    <li>Pointer: A reference to the next node in the list</li>
</ul>
<p>The first node in the linked list is called the head, No nodes point to the head.</p>
<p>The last node in the linked list is called the tail. Since there are no nodes after it, the tail's pointer is set to null or <code id="code">None</code>.</p>

<h2 id="title">Traversing a Linked List</h2>
<p>To traverse a linked list, start at the head and follow the pointers to each subsequent node until you reach the tail.</p>
<p>For example, given the following linked list:</p>
<code id="code">head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None</code>
<p>You can traverse it like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start at the head (1)</li>
    <li>Follow the pointer to the next node (2)</li>
    <li>Follow the pointer to the next node (3)</li>
    <li>Follow the pointer to the next node (4)</li>
    <li>Follow the pointer to None, indicating the end of the list</li>
</ul>
<p>In code, this can be done using a while loop:</p>
<pre id="code">
current = head<br>
while current is not None:<br>
    print(current.data)<br>
    current = current.next<br>
</pre>

<h2 id="title">Linked List Operations</h2>
<p>Common operations on linked lists include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accessing: Retrieving the value of a node</li>
    <li>Insertion: Adding a new node to the list</li>
    <li>Deletion: Removing a node from the list</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accessing the Front of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To access the front of a linked list, simply return the head node.</p>
<pre id="code">
print(head.val)<br>
</pre>
<h3>Accessing the Back of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To access the back of a linked list, traverse the list until you reach the tail node.</p>
<pre id="code">
current = head<br>
while current.next is not None:<br>
    current = current.next<br>
print(current.val)<br>
</pre>
<h3>Accessing Somewhere in the Middle of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To access a node in the middle of a linked list, you can use a loop to traverse the list until you reach the desired index or value</p>
<pre id="code">
current = head<br>
index = 0<br>
while current is not None and index < target_index:<br>
    current = current.next<br>
    index += 1<br>
if current is not None:<br>
    print(current.val)<br>
else:<br>
    print("Index out of range")<br>
</pre>

<h3>Inserting a Node at the Front of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To insert a new node at the front of a linked list, create a new node and set its pointer to the current head. Then update the head to point to the new node.</p>
<pre id="code">
new_node = Node(value)<br>
new_node.next = head<br>
head = new_node<br>
</pre>
<h3>Inserting a Node at the Back of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To insert a new node at the back of a linked list, traverse the list until you reach the tail node. Then create a new node and set the tail's pointer to point to the new node.</p>
<pre id="code">
current = head<br>
while current.next is not None:<br>
    current = current.next<br>
new_node = Node(value)<br>
current.next = new_node<br>
</pre>
<h3>Inserting a Node Somewhere in the Middle of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To insert a new node somewhere in the middle of a linked list, traverse the list until you reach the desired index or value. Then create a new node and set its pointer to the current node's pointer. Finally, update the current node's pointer to point to the new node.</p>
<pre id="code">
current = head<br>
index = 0<br>
while current is not None and index < target_index - 1:<br>
    current = current.next<br>
    index += 1<br>
if current is not None:<br>
    new_node = Node(value)<br>
    new_node.next = current.next<br>
    current.next = new_node<br>
else:<br>
    print("Index out of range")<br>
</pre>

<h3>Deleting a Node at the Front of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To delete a node at the front of a linked list, simply update the head to point to the next node.</p>
<pre id="code">
head = head.next<br>
</pre>
<h3>Deleting a Node at the Back of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To delete a node at the back of a linked list, traverse the list until you reach the second-to-last node. Then set its pointer to None.</p>
<pre id="code">
current = head<br>
while current.next.next is not None:<br>
    current = current.next<br>
current.next = None<br>
</pre>
<h3>Deleting a Node Somewhere in the Middle of a Linked List</h3>
<p>To delete a node somewhere in the middle of a linked list, traverse the list until you reach the desired index or value. Then update the previous node's pointer to skip the current node.</p>
<pre id="code">
current = head<br>
index = 0<br>
while current is not None and index < target_index - 1:<br>
    current = current.next<br>
    index += 1<br>
if current is not None and current.next is not None:<br>
    current.next = current.next.next<br>
else:<br>
    print("Index out of range")<br>
</pre>
