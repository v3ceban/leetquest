<h2 id="title">Nodes and Multiple Linked Lists</h2>
<p>The following problems will involve multiple linked lists, but the principles of how nodes are connected and how to traverse them will remain the same. The only difference is that there will be multiple linked lists to traverse.</p>
<p>Just like in single linked list problems, multiple pointers are helpful when it comes to reassigning the pointer of a node and access to the list has to be maintained. This idea also applies to multiple pointers across different lists.</p>
