<p>For some problems, it is nice to create your own hash map in order to create a mapping that is useful in the context of the problem.</p>
<p>For example, you can map numbers to letters of the alphabet.</p>
<p>In this case, you can create a hash map with the following syntax:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code id="code">hash_map = {key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}</code></li>
</ul>
