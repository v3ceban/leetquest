<h2 id="title">Inching Window</h2>
<p>Another type of sliding window is what I would like to call an inching window, where the size of the window changes as the pointers take turns moving. Typically in these types of problems, the pointers take turns moving until a certain condition is met, similar to standard two pointer problems.
<ul>
    <li>I call it an inching window because it resembles an inchworm, where the body of the inchworm is the window and the head and tail are the two pointers. The head and tail take turns moving forward while the horizontal space the inchworm occupies changes as it moves forward.</li>
</ul>
