<h2 id="title">What is Sliding Window?</h2>
<p>Sliding window is a technique used to solve problems that involve ordered structures, such as arrays or strings. It involves maintaining a window (a subarray or subsequence) that can slide over the input data to find a solution.</p>
<p>The bounds of the window is implemented using two pointers, which can be moved independently to expand or contract the window size.</p>
<h2 id="subtitle">Two Pointers vs Sliding Window</h2>
<p>Sliding window is a specific case of the two pointers technique. While two pointers can be used to solve a variety of problems, sliding window is specifically used for problems that involve finding a subarray or subsequence that meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>In general, the two pointers technique places emphasis on the elements that the pointers are pointing to, while sliding window places emphasis on all of the elements that fall between the two pointers.</p>
<h2 id="subtitle">Rolling Window</h2>
<p>One type of sliding window is what I would like to call a rolling window, where the size of the window is fixed. When the left pointer moves, the right pointer moves right after in order to maintain the window's size. This is useful for problems that require you to find a subarray of a specific size that meets certain criteria.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I call it a rolling window because it resembles a window on any motor vehicle, where the tires of the vehicle are doing the rolling. The window is physically moving, but the size of the window remainds unchanged.</li>
</ul>
