<h2 id="title">Combining Hash Maps and Sliding Window</h2>
<p>Sliding window is a powerful technique, but has its limitations when it comes to storing information about the elements in the window. For example, if you want to count the number of occurrences of each element in the window, a few variables would not be sufficient. Fortunately, we know that hash sets or hash maps are great for storing information about the elements in a list. So, we can combine the two techniques to solve problems where it would be helpful to know more detailed information about the elements in the window.</p>

<p>The following problems will combine rolling windows with the additional implementation of hash sets and hash maps to store additional information.</p>
