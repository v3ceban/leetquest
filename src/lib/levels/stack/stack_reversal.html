<h2 id="title">Using Stacks to Reverse Structures</h2>
<p>In very rare cases, it can be useful to reverse structures using a list due to the nature of how stacks work.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a list of elements and you want to reverse the order of the elements, you can push each element onto a stack and then pop them off.
<ul>
    <li>Due to the stack's inherent nature of first-in-last-out (FILO), the last element pushed onto the stack will be the first one popped off.</li>
    <li>This means that after popping all the elements off the stack, the order of the elements will be reversed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you have a stack <code id="code">stack = [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>, popping them off onto an array will give you:</p>
<code id="terminal"><green>></green> arr = [4, 3, 2, 1]</code>
