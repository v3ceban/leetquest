<h2 id="title">Mapping Strings to Other Strings</h2>
<p>Other common uses for hash maps are mapping a string to another string. </p>
<p>For example, you can use a hash map to implement a substitution cipher, where each letter in the alphabet is replaced with another letter.</p>
<p>In this case, the key would be the letter in the alphabet, and the value would be the letter it is replaced with.</p>
<h2 id="subtitle">Example</h2>
<p>If you want to replace the letter 'a' with 'b', you would add the following entry to the hash map:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code id="code">hash_map['a'] = 'b'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, when you want to encrypt a message, you can iterate through the message and replace each letter with its corresponding value in the hash map.</p>
<p>If you want to encrypt the message "hello", you would do the following:</p>
<pre id="code">
<p>encrypted_message = ""</p>
<p>for letter in message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encrypted_message += hash_map[letter]</p>
<p>print(encrypted_message)</p>
</pre>
<p>This would print the encrypted message, where each letter has been replaced with its corresponding value in the hash map.</p>
