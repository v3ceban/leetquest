<h2 id="title">Transfering Information Through Recursion</h2>
<p>Recursion is a powerful tool in programming that allows us to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. In this section, we will explore how recursion can be used to transfer information between the subproblems and the main problem above it.</p>

<h3>A Familiar Example</h3>
<p>Consider the factorial function, which is defined as:</p>
<pre id="code">
def factorial(n):<br>
    if n == 1:<br>
        return 1<br>
    else:<br>
        return n * factorial(n - 1)<br>
</pre>
<p>In this example, the recursive function <code id="code">factorial</code> calculates the factorial of a number <code id="code">n</code> by multiplying it with the factorial of <code id="code">n - 1</code>. The base case is when <code id="code">n</code> is equal to 0, at which point the function returns 1.</p>
<p>As we can see, the information (the factorial value) is transferred back up the recursion stack as each recursive call returns its result.</p>
<p>For example, if we called <code id="code">factorial(5)</code>, the function would execute as follows:</p>
<pre id="code" style="overflow: scroll">
factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)<br>
factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * factorial(3)<br>
factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * factorial(2)<br>
factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)<br>
factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1<br>
factorial(5) = 120<br>
</pre>

<p>As we can see, the information is transferred back up the recursion stack as each recursive call returns its result.</p>
<h3>Transferring Information in Tree Traversals</h3>
<p>In tree traversals, we can also transfer information between the subproblems and the main problem above it. For example, consider a binary tree where we want to calculate the sum of all the nodes in the tree.</p>
<p>We can use recursion to traverse the tree and calculate the sum of all the nodes:</p>
<pre id="code" style="overflow: scroll">
def sum_tree(node):<br>
    if node is None:<br>
        return 0<br>
    else:<br>
        return node.val + sum_tree(node.left) + sum_tree(node.right)<br>
</pre>

<p>In this example, the recursive function <code id="code">sum_tree</code> calculates the sum of all the nodes in the tree by adding the value of the current node to the sum of the left and right subtrees. The base case is when the node is <code id="code">None</code>, at which point the function returns 0.</p>
<p>Most of the problems following this will utilize recursion in this way, where we will be transferring information from the subproblems to the main problem above it.</p>
