<h2 id="title">What is a Tree?</h2>
<p>A tree is a data structure consisting of objects called nodes</p>
<p>Each node has the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The value stored in the node</li>
    <li>Two pointers, left and right, to different nodes in the tree</li>
</ul>
<p>The first node in the tree is called the root, No nodes point to the root.</p>
<p>Nodes that have pointers to other nodes have child nodes.</p>
<p>Nodes that are pointed to by other nodes have parent nodes.</p>
<p>Nodes that have no child nodes are called leaf nodes.</p>

<h2 id="subtitle">Traversing a Tree</h2>
<p>If we try to traverse a tree like we did with a linked list, we will run into a problem. If we follow a branch in a tree to its leaf node, we will not be able to go back up the tree to follow another branch.</p>
<p>To traverse a tree, we will have to use recursion to backtrack to previous nodes we have visited.</p>
<p>For example, given the following tree:</p>
<code id="code">   1   <br> 2  3 <br>4 5 6 7</code>
<p>We can traverse it like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start at the root (1)</li>
    <li>Follow the left pointer to the next node (2)</li>
    <li>Follow the left pointer to the next node (4)</li>
    <li>Since 4 has no children, backtrack to 2</li>
    <li>Follow the right pointer to the next node (5)</li>
    <li>Since 5 has no children, backtrack to 2</li>
    <li>Since we have visited all children of 2, backtrack to 1</li>
    <li>Follow the right pointer to the next node (3)</li>
    <li>Follow the left pointer to the next node (6)</li>
    <li>Since 6 has no children, backtrack to 3</li>
    <li>Follow the right pointer to the next node (7)</li>
    <li>Since 7 has no children, backtrack to 3</li>
    <li>Since we have visited all children of 3, backtrack to 1</li>
    <li>Since we have visited all children of 1, we are done</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="subtitle">Brief Lesson in Recursion</h2>
<p>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems, in this instance, breaking down a tree into smaller subtrees.</p>
<p>To use recursion, we need to define a base case and a recursive case.</p>
<p>The base case is the condition that stops the recursion. In this case, the base case is when we reach null.</p>
<p>The recursive case is the condition that continues the recursion. In this case, the recursive case is when we follow the left and right pointers to the next nodes.</p>
<p>In code, this can be done using a function that calls itself:</p>
<pre id="code">
def traverse_tree(node):<br>
    # Base case: node is null<br>
    if node is None:<br>
        return<br>
    
    # Recursive case: follow children<br>
    traverse_tree(node.left)<br>
    traverse_tree(node.right)<br>
</pre>

<h2 id="subtitle">Different Tree Traversals</h2>
<h3>Preorder Traversal</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1. Track the current node</li>
    <li>2. Recurse on the left subtree</li>
    <li>3. Recurse on the right subtree</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inorder Traversal</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1. Recurse on the left subtree</li>
    <li>2. Track the current node</li>
    <li>3. Recurse on the right subtree</li>
</ul>

<h3>Postorder Traversal</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1. Recurse on the left subtree</li>
    <li>2. Recurse on the right subtree</li>
    <li>3. Track the current node</li>
