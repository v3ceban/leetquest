<h2 id="title">A Small Warning</h2>
<p>This node doesn't teach you any new concepts, but it is here to separate the following problems from the previous ones, since the applications of two pointers may be more difficult to identify in the following problems.</p>
<h3>Remember the Principles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Initialize the two pointers at points that make the most sense in the problem. Most of the time, this is on the opposite ends of the array.</li>
    <li>Create a while loop that loops until a certain condition is met or the two pointers meet in the middle.</li>
    <li>Iterate one pointer at a time under a certain condition.</li>
</ul>
